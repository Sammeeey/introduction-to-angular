## improvements
- search for different parts of locations (not just city; in searchHousingLocations of housing-list.component.ts) - as [suggested in step 6](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/introduction-to-angular#5)
- [*use services in Angular*](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/introduction-to-angular#4) to share data between components (instead of *Input decorator*) - as suggested in [intro step 5](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/introduction-to-angular#4)
- implement functionality to *undisplay* opened details (e.g. by click on same button, which displays details (which changes it's text & functionality to *undisplay* after click on initial *view*))
- implement cursor change to click intent on hover over clickable elements

### details2
> - use [chat gpt suggested approach](https://chat.openai.com/c/46d0493c-5319-49e6-b79d-3efd6b94d5b3) to display details directly below location name (maybe even be able to toggle (open/close) on click?!)
