## improvements
- search for different parts of locations (not just city; in searchHousingLocations of housing-list.component.ts)
- [*use services in Angular*](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/introduction-to-angular#4) to share data between components (instead of *Input decorator*) - as suggested in [intro step 5](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/introduction-to-angular#4)

### details2
> - use [chat gpt suggested approach](https://chat.openai.com/c/46d0493c-5319-49e6-b79d-3efd6b94d5b3) to display details directly below location name (maybe even be able to toggle (open/close) on click?!)
